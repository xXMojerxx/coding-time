# OPPERATORS (o-o )
Opperators are what are used within variables as well as functions to change their values. They come in different types of forms, but here is a basic understand of arithmetic opperators that you would use when programming:

| opperator name | description | explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| () | values within () are completed first | if given 2 ( 2 + 4 ), ( 2 + 4 ) would run first, then it would do the rest of the equation |
| exponent** | mutiplies the number by itself by the amount of times indicated | 3 ** 2 would evaluate to 9 because 3 * 3 = 9 |
| unary- | makes the value go first if onyl assigned to a variable | 2 * -x -> would calculate -x first then multiply it to 2 |
| */% | multiplication, division, mod. Mod is used to divide and compute the remainder left over | 3 * 3 = 9, 8 / 2 = 4, 5 % 2 = 1 |
| + - | addition and subtraction, very self explanitory | 40 - 12 = 28, 6 + 6 = 12 |
