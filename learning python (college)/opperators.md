# OPPERATORS (o-o )
Opperators are what are used within variables as well as functions to change their values. They come in different types of forms, for example:
## Arithmatic Opperators
Used to perform common mathematical equations when assigned a value. 
| opperator name | description | explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| () | values within () are completed first | if given 2 ( 2 + 4 ), ( 2 + 4 ) would run first, then it would do the rest of the equation |
| exponent** | mutiplies the number by itself by the amount of times indicated | 3 ** 2 would evaluate to 9 because 3 * 3 = 9 |
| unary- | makes the value go first if onyl assigned to a variable | 2 * -x -> would calculate -x first then multiply it to 2 |
| */% | multiplication, division, mod. Mod is used to divide and compute the remainder left over | 3 * 3 = 9, 8 / 2 = 4, 5 % 2 = 1 |
| + - | addition and subtraction, very self explanitory | 40 - 12 = 28, 6 + 6 = 12 |

## Assignment Opperators
Assigns a value to a variable bassed on a condition that has to be met. For example:
| opperator name | description | explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| = | assigns a value to a variable | varaible = 2 <--- assigns the value '2' to the variable 'variable' |
| += OR -= | adds or subtracts onto the given varaible | x = x + 2 <--- adds 2 more onto the given value |
| *= OR /= | multiplies or divides onto the given variable | x = x * 2 <--- multiplies 2 ontop of the given value |

## Comparison Opperators
Compares two different values
| opperator name | description | explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| == | checks if both values is equal to one another | if 4 == 5: <--- checks if 4 is equal to 5, runs program if true |
| != | checks if one balue IS NOT EQUAL TO the other value | if people != population: <--- checks if variable people is NOT EQUAL TO variable population, runs program if true |
| > OR < | checks if one value is greater than or less than the other | if 5 < 9: <--- checks if 5 is less than 9, runs program if true |
| >= OR <= | checks if one value is greater than or equal to / less than or equal to the other | if 200 >= 15: <--- checks if 200 is greater than or equal too 15, runs program if true |
