# VARIABLES (._ .)

Variables (just like any programming language) assigns a value to a certain work or phrase. For python, ***its very simplistic***, in which you can assign a value by:
```py
string_value = 'hello there' #string values need to be in single quotation marks

num_value = 2
```
But we can alter these variables by assigning it built-in function!!! For a starter, we can understand how to do an input value as well as alter this input value. To complete this, we can use the functions of:
```py
user_input = input() 
#grabs a user input and assigns it to the value

number_to_string = int() 
#converts a string value to a numerical value

user_input_number = int(input())
#when grabing the users input, changes it to numerical value
```
But with these variables, we need to understand how to identify or create identifiers for our variables. Identifiers are basically what to call your variable's name. Within programming, we need to have meaningful indentifiers to understand where certain parts of code is. But to have a meaningful name does not mean you need to elongate a variable's name. It should be clear and concise for us to understand and to easily use. To understand ***how to create an indetifier***, use this table (unless you already know how to make a meaningful variable, then good job):
| Non-meaningful names | Meaningful names |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| hello = 'Bob'        | person_name = 'Bob' |
| kldjajd = 2004       | birth_date = 2004 |
| p = 'Hello!!! My name is _____' | letter_introduction = 'Hello!!! My name is _____' |
