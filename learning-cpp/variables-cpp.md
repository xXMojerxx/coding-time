In C++, there are different type of variable. Each variable is indicated by the type of the variable given. So when coding in c++, look out for the different type of variable used! Here are the most basic types of variable:
```cpp
int myNum = 5; // stores integers without decimals

double myFloatNum = 5.99; //stores float integers with decimals

char myLetter = 'a'; //stores single character values (only using 'single quotation')

string myText = "Hello World"; //strong text, surrounded by "double quotes"

bool myBoolean = true; //stores values with two states: true or false
```
...Also when calling variable, you can call multiple variable in the same type! By doing this, you can reduce the amount of lines used for called each individual variable. For example:
```cpp
int x, y, z; //Calling x, y, and z in the same variable type. :)
x = 12;
y = 15;
z = 1000;
cout << x + y + z
```
