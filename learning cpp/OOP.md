To first clear things up, OOP is also known as Object Oriented Programming. Objects created from OOP contrain data as well as functions that are ment to be performed. OPP contains two different aspects:

### ``` CLASSES ``` 
Classes are a template that are ment to hold objects within. Classes are usualy indicated by broader terms such as fruits, cars, bags, etc.
### ``` OBJECTS ```
Objects are more specific terms that tells the specifics of whats within the class. They are mostly indicated by specifics terms such as Apple/Bannana, Toyota/Mercedes, Jansport/Calvin Klein, etc.

## To create a class, you first:
```cpp
class theClass { /* This creates the class with the indicated name */ 
  public: /* This specifies what the access is going to be */
    int myNum; /* This creates the variable that is going to be used within the class */
    string myString; /* This also creates another variable that is going to be used within the class*/
};
```
## To create an object, you first:
```cpp


```
