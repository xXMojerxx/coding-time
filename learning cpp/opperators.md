# OPPERATORS (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
There are 4 different types of opperators; arithmatic opperators, assignement opperators, comparison opperators, and logical operators. Each opperator has a different task to accomplish for a function:
### ARITHMATIC
Arithmatic opperators are used as common mathematical opperations. For example, adding two different variable together or subtracting three variables from one another. Mainly used when having to change the value of varialbes in real time
### ASSIGNMENT
Assignment opperators are used to assign values to variables. Assignment opperators are used to add values to variables or change values to variables without having to create another arithmatic opperator
### COMPARISON
Comparison opperators are used to compare two different values/variables together (used to make decisions). Everytime when you use comparison opperators, you check if the comparison is true or false and returns the respective answer back
### LOGICAL
Logical opperators are used to determin the logic between variables or values. Used to compare the comparison opperators (I honestly dont know what to put here :P)
##
Here are a few examples of the different types of opperators:
```cpp
/* Arithmatic opperator */

int a = 10 + 5; // Adds 10 and 5 and assigns it to the variable 'a'
int b = 5 * 2; // Multiplies 5 by 2 and assigns it to the variable 'b'

/* Assignment Opperator */

int c = 10; 
c -= 5; // Subtraction assingment to subtract 5 from the value of 'c'
int d = 10; 
d /= 2; // Division assingment to divide 2 from the value of 'd'

/* Comparison Opperator */

int e = 10; 
int f = 20; 
cout << (e < f); // Compares if 'e' IS LESS THAN 'f'
cout << (e != f); // Compares if 'e' IS NOT EQUAL TO 'f'

/* Logical Opperator */

int g = 15; 
int h = 20; 
cout << (g == 15 && h > 15); // Checks if the comparisons are correct for 'g' AND 'h'
cout << (g < 15 || h != 20); // Check if the comparisons are correct for 'g' OR 'h'
```
