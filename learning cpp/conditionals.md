# CONDITIONALs :)
Conditionals (Also known as conditional statements) are used to check and compare two different opperators. If the statement returns as true, that means it would run the code function. If the statement returns as false, it would skip the code segment and continute to run as normal.
Some common statements that are well known are:

```IF STATEMENTS``` -> If statements are most commonly used when coding. Checks if the condition returns as true, and if false, skips the code segment

```IF-ELSE STATEMENTS``` -> If-else state
